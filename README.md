These are my hyprland dotfiles. very loosely based on hypr_arch from https://gitlab.com/prolinux410/owl_dots/-/tree/main/hyprland/hypr_arch?ref_type=heads. wofi config is literally stolen from here: https://github.com/nabakdev/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/wofi

You can switch between different styles using $MainMod + F1-F12

At system startup, no style will be selected, so please select one

Includes a language switch, default at en/ru(phonetic)

I probably have some hardcoded paths with my username (zmeyka), and if thats the case, please report them
